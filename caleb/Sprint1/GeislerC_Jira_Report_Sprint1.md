Workflow Discipline:  
\-Check only the steps followed during the sprint

- [x] Issues moved through workflow states (To Do \-\> In Progress \-\> Done)  
- [x] Issues closed only after acceptance criteria met  
- [x] Sprint completed/closed in Jira

Blockers & Scope Changes:

* Major Blockers-  
  * My Onboarding was necessary to complete before I could start work.  
* Scope Changes-  
  * Adding Testing and Test Coverage to my todo for the sprint as I could do more work than previously applied to my workload.  
* Why work spilled over (if any)  
  * Not Applicable
