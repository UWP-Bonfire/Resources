Workflow Discipline:  
\-Check only the steps followed during the sprint

- [x] Issues moved through workflow states (To Do \-\> In Progress \-\> Done)  
- [x] Issues closed only after acceptance criteria met  
- [x] Sprint completed/closed in Jira

Blockers & Scope Changes:

* Major Blockers-  
  * Existing bugs from previous semester caused us to focus on fixes over new features  
* Why work spilled over (if any)  
  * Focusing on bugs led to us putting effort into bugs over test coverage. Also didn’t hear back from Matt soon enough for what to use for test coverage
